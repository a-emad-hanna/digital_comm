# Gram-Schmidt procedure and BER Analysis for Digital Communication Systems
 
## Project Overview
This project implements a MATLAB code to:
1. Generate the minimum number of orthonormal basis functions using the Gram-Schmidt procedure for an arbitrary number of input signals.
2. Plot the input signals and corresponding orthonormal basis functions.
3. Generate the constellation diagram and calculate symbol energy.
4. Analyze the Bit Error Rate (BER) of binary polar NRZ-encoded data transmitted through an AWGN channel and compare the results with theoretical BER.

## Features
- Input M signals matrix and compute N orthonormal basis functions.
- Plot M input signals and N basis functions.
- Generate and visualize the constellation diagram for the input signals.
- Calculate symbol energy using the constellation diagram.
- Simulate binary polar NRZ system and transmit it through an AWGN channel.
- Analyze BER under different noise power levels and compare theoretical and practical results.
